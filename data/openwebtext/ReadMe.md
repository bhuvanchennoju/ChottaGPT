## Openwebtext  

Breif about the dataset: OpenWebText is an open-source recreation of the WebText corpus. The text is web content extracted from URLs shared on Reddit with at least three upvotes. (38GB).

This file downloads the data for this project, and save it to disk in binary format.
based on karpthy's implementation of nanoGPTs I am writing this code to download, and process the openwebtext, in full, or sample 10k datasets.
